# When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an initial value of undefined. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be NaN

# const has all the awesome features that let has, with the added bonus that variables declared using const are read-only. They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned:

# declaration let use when you want to change value, declaration const use when you don't want to change value never again.

# single and double quotes work the same in JavaScript.

#
Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\t	tab
\r	carriage return
\b	backspace
\f	form feed

# I need to  and the space when i concatenation between strings.

#  we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.
# It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.
# Note: Boolean values are never written with quotes. The strings "true" and "false" are not Boolean and have no special meaning in JavaScript.
